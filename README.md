##  A bit more about me...
So, my name is Porag. I am a Computer Science major and a full-stack software engineer with 2+ years of experience specializing in Spring Boot, and Angular building enterprise solutions.
- I know how to get to the best possible solution by catching the client's pulse, working to tight deadlines, collaborating between teams, resolving conflicts, and learning fast when necessary.

<br>

### A bit of background...
- After completing my bachelor's in Computer Science in 2020 I did my first internship on full-stack web development. After this, I got an offer and joined my first IT job in 2021 as a junior full-stack developer. Where I worked with Java, and Spring Boot on the backend, and used TypeScript, and Angular on the front end on 3+ ERP software solutions serving 200+ clients. I also prepared and presented more than 5 product presentations among which the client retention rate is more than 90%. 

<br>

### What am I upto now...
- Iâ€™ve been spending the last several months sharpening my development skills even more by collaborating with people from 6 different timezones remotely at Microverse, an online training school, intensely focusing on the core to advanced full-stack technical skill development. 
- As well as achieving important soft skills like self-reflection, professionalism, and cross-cultural communication. All through remote pair programming project by project, capstone by capstone. 
- I am on a mission to join a strong tech company working remotely and I am proud of the steps I am taking to achieve this.

<br> <br>

And thank you so much for your attention. God bless you and I would be more than happy to hear from you soon for any other info you would like...
## Cheers!
